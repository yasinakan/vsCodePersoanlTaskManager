# Personal Task Manager

This is a sample VS Code extension that demonstrates how to use virtual documents and register commands.

## Commands

- `cowsay.say`: Opens a cowsay document.
- `cowsay.backwards`: Reverses the text in the current cowsay document.
- `helloWorld.show`: Shows a "Hello World" message.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Launch Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
	- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
	- Run the extension in a new VS Code window
